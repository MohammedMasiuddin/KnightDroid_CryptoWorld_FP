          <p>Cryptocurrency markets are decentralised, which means they are not issued or backed by a central
            authority such as a government. Instead, they run across a network of computers. However,
            cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold via exchanges and stored in ‘wallets’ </p>

          <p>Cryptocurrencies are almost always designed to be free from government manipulation and
            control—although, as they have grown more popular, this foundational aspect of the industry has
            come under fire. The cryptocurrencies modeled after Bitcoin are collectively called altcoins,
            and in some cases shitcoins, and have often tried to present themselves as modified or improved
            versions of Bitcoin. While some of these currencies may have some impressive features that
            Bitcoin does not, matching the level of security that Bitcoin’s networks achieve largely has yet
            to be seen by an altcoin.</p>

          <p id="marketcap" class="headings">Market Cap:$ <span> 2,272,096,483,580 </span> </p>
          <p>Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company’s
            stock — or, in the case of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, of all the coins that have been
            mined. In crypto, market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have
            been mined by the price of a single coin at any given time. One way to think about market cap is
            as a rough gauge for how stable an asset is likely to be.
            (It’s important to note that even Bitcoin, crypto’s biggest market cap, still sees volatility.)
            But the same way a bigger ship can safely navigate heavy weather, a cryptocurrency with a much
            larger market cap is more likely to be a more stable investment than one with a much smaller
            market cap. Conversely digital currencies with smaller market caps are more susceptible to the
            whims of the market – and can see huge gains or dramatic losses in their wake.</p>

          <p>Volume is what makes exchanges money. They collect transaction fees on trades through their
            platform—typically a percentage of the total value traded. ... For you, as a cryptocurrency
            investor, exchange volume is equally important. Exchanges are your best bet at buying, selling,
            and trading cryptocurrencies. Along with circulating supply and market capitalization, the
            volume is one of the most prominent
            metrics in crypto. Volume is such an important metric when analyzing cryptos and it can help you
            in showing a coin’s direction. The volume of a token listed on CoinMarketCap is quite simple.
            It’s the amount of the coin that has been traded in the last 24 hours. volume underscores how
            many people are buying and selling the coin.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin dominance is the ratio between the market capitalization
            The market capitalization (or market cap) of a cryptocurrency is a measurement of its market
            value. In other words, it...
            of Bitcoin to the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. When we compare this
            ratio to the trend of Bitcoin itself, we can learn more about what opportunities the current
            market environment offers.

            To gain a better understanding of what Bitcoin dominance is, traders need to understand what
            market capitalization is — and why it’s important.</p>

          <p id="ethdom" class="headings">Etherum dominance: <span>21.15%</span></p>
          <p>The dominance of Ethereum (ETH) increased over the course of 2021 - after an initial decline -
            but was not as high as it was back in 2017. Within the crypto world, this so-called "dominance"
            ratio is one of the oldest and most investigated metrices available. It measures the coin's
            market cap relative to the overall crypto market - for instance, it shows how strong Bitcoin is
            compared to all the other cryptocurrencies that are not BTC, called "altcoins". In the case of
            Ethereum, the dominance somewhat reveals how often it is used for smart contracts and whether it
            is a popular blockchain for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.</p>

          <p id="mcapchange" class="headings">Market Cap change : <span>1.00%</span></p>
          <p>In April 2021, the Bitcoin market cap reached an all-time high and had grown by over 1,000
            billion USD when compared to the summer months. The market capitalization decline since that
            moment, reaching roughly 600 billion U.S. dollars in June 2021. Market capitalization is
            calculated by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by the Bitcoin price. The
            Bitcoin market capitalization increased from approximately one billion U.S. dollars in 2013 to
            several times this amount since its surge in popularity in 2017. Bitcoin use among consumers
            while its market capitalization grew at an unbelievable rate from 2013 to 2017, the public is
            only slowly becoming aware of its existence. As many as 25 percent of Americans were still not
            familiar with bitcoin and as of 2019. While there are over 18 million bitcoins in circulation,
            there are only 6,674 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. So its physical presence is minimal, and the
            majority of ATMs are located in the United States.</p>

          <p id="volchange" class="headings"> Volume change <span>-32.83</span></p>
          <p>Volume can show the direction and movement of the cryptocurrency as well as a prediction of
            future price and its demand.

            The 24-hour volume section at the top of CoinMarketCap website shows the total value of crypto
            traded in the past 24 hours.
            Volume is an extremely important indicator for traders to determine the future profitability of
            cryptocurrencies. It also helps exchanges make money by charging fees on cryptocurrency trades
            offered on their
            platforms. A greater volume of cryptocurrency transactions leads to fair cryptocurrency prices
            and removes
            the chance of distorted pricing. A low cryptocurrency exchange volume signals inefficient or low
            trades, as the asking prices of
            sellers fail to meet the bids of potential buyers. Cryptocurrency volume is similar to the
            concept of liquidity, but they are both not the same.
            Volume is the sum total of actual trades taking place, meanwhile liquidity is the amount
            available for trading at any single price. Usually, the higher the volume of cryptocurrency
            transactions, the more liquid the crypto market
            will be.</p>

          <p id="avgchange" class="headings"> Average change percentage <span>0.9</span> </p>
          <p>Cryptocurrency indexes such as the most well known CoinMarketCap tell users what the day in
            cryptocurrency looks like by displaying the “24 hour change in price” in % format. The way this
            is done however, can be very misleading and often confusing. It can make some days look like the
            beginning of a huge bear market and others look like the beginning of an enormous bull market,
            while making some look like the price hasn’t moved at all. All while the price isn’t currently
            moving, at all. That is, you can see the price today stay completely solid at $100 and yet the
            percentage change over the 24 hour period will fluctuate wildly. To understand what I mean, it’s
            important to understand what they mean by the 24 hour rolling
            period. You see, crypto indexes were made like stock indexes and stock indexes have a % change
            since market open and that’s what they show as the change for that day. This is possible because
            stock markets open at certain hours and then close for the day. Some days they aren’t open at
            all. Cryptocurrency markets are open at all times, 24/7, so this type of calculation is not
            possible. There is no market open and market close.</p>

      <p>What is Crypto?</p>
      <p>A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number
        of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and
        central authorities.

        The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure the
        network.

        Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including
        finance and law.</p>
